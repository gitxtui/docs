The Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the
size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or
put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy
User Guide).

Try answering these questions for your user in this page:

## What is it?

GitX is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) helper designed to simplify the process of learning and using Git, the most widely used version control system (VCS). Instead of typing long and often confusing commands, GitX presents a more guided and interactive interface that helps beginners understand Git concepts while still working inside the terminal. It is especially useful for students, new developers, or anyone who wants to strengthen their Git fundamentals by not only providing an easy access to all the git functions but also educating about doing all the said exercises manually. 

## Why do I want it?

This tool significantly boosts your knowledge on the integration and working of `git` and `github` (NOT THE SAME THING) and for seasoned users, provides an efficient way to navigate through the respective functions.

## Disclaimer:

Although `gitx` provides an easier and more efficient way to access all the functions with simple keystrokes. It is still not recommended for beginners who are looking for a way-around those functions, this documentation involves theoretical explanation of each and every function who's knowledge will be necessary before they're used in the professional world. 

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

- [Installation](/docs/docs/getting-started/installation): Install GITx
- [Tutorials](/docs/docs/tutorials/): Check out some tutorials for git!
