**Branch** in Git is like a parallel universe of your project.  
It lets you work on new features without disturbing the main codebase.

## Why Branches?

Imagine your project has a `main` branch.  
You want to add a new feature. Instead of risking changes on `main`, you:

1. Create a new branch.
2. Work on it separately.
3. Merge it back when ready.

Git provides the ability to create **branches** so developers can work on new features or bug fixes without disturbing the main codebase.  
Changes you make to a branch are stored separately from other branches. You can **switch** between branches at any time. When your changes are ready and working, you can **merge** the branch back into your main branch.
