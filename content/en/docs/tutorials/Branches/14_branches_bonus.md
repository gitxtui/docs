This section covers advanced and useful Git concepts related to branching, history, and project management.  
Even if you’re new to Git, these tools and ideas will help you understand and recover your project in tricky situations!

## Tags vs Branches

### What is a Tag?

- A **tag** is a fixed pointer to a specific commit.
- Used to mark important points in history, like releases (`v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`).
- Tags do **not** move—they always point to the same commit.

**Create a tag:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

**List tags:**
```bash
git tag
```

**Push tags to remote:**
```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### How is a Tag Different from a Branch?

| Tag                        | Branch                           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Fixed pointer to a commit  | Movable pointer to latest commit |
| Used for releases/versions | Used for ongoing development     |
| Does not change            | Moves as new commits are added   |

## Detached HEAD & Temporary Branches

### What is Detached HEAD?

- **HEAD** is Git’s pointer to your current branch.
- **Detached HEAD** means HEAD points directly to a commit, not a branch.
- Happens when you checkout a specific commit:
  ```bash
  git checkout a1b2c3d
  ```
- You’re "not on a branch"—any new commits are not attached to a branch.

### Why Use Detached HEAD?

- Experiment with changes without affecting any branch.
- Review or test old versions of your code.

### How to Save Work from Detached HEAD

If you want to keep your work:

```bash
git switch -c temp-branch
```
- This creates a new branch from your current state, saving your changes.

## Orphan Branches

### What is an Orphan Branch?

- An **orphan branch** starts with **no history**—it’s a completely fresh branch.
- Useful for creating documentation, gh-pages, or starting a new project in the same repo.

**Create an orphan branch:**
```bash
git checkout --orphan docs
```
- Your working directory stays the same, but the branch has no commits.
- Add and commit files as usual.

## Reflog: Recover Lost Commits and Branches

### What is Reflog?

- **Reflog** records every change to HEAD (branch checkouts, commits, resets, etc.).
- Lets you recover lost commits, branches, or undo mistakes—even after deletion.

**View reflog:**
```bash
git reflog
```
- Shows a list of recent HEAD positions.

**Recover a deleted branch:**
1. Find the commit hash in `git reflog`.
2. Create a branch from it:
   ```bash
   git branch recovered-branch <commit-hash>
   ```

## Bisecting: Find the Buggy Commit

### What is Bisecting?

- **git bisect** helps you find which commit introduced a bug by binary search.
- You mark a "good" commit and a "bad" commit, and Git checks commits in between.

**Start bisect:**
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                # Mark current commit as bad
git bisect good a1b2c3d       # Mark known good commit
```
- Git checks out a commit in the middle. Test it, then mark as `good` or `bad`.
- Repeat until you find the exact commit that introduced the bug.

**Finish bisect:**
```bash
git bisect reset
```

## Visualization Tools

### Command-Line Visualization

- **Show commit history as a graph:**
  ```bash
  git log --oneline --graph --all
  ```
- **Show branches and merges visually.**

### GUI Tools

- **Gitk:**  
  Run `gitk` for a graphical history viewer.
- **SourceTree, GitKraken:**  
  Free tools for visualizing branches, merges, and history.
- **VS Code GitLens:**  
  Powerful extension for viewing history and branch structure inside VS Code.
