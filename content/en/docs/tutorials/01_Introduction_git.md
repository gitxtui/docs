> **Git** is an open source, distributed version control system (VCS) that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others efficiently.

Imagine you’re writing a book. You make changes every day—sometimes adding new chapters, sometimes fixing typos. After a few weeks, you wonder: _What if I want to see the old draft? What if two people are editing the same chapter?_

This is where **Git** comes in.

## What is a Version Control System?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** keeps track of all the code added to a project. It preserves the history of your project, allowing you to:

- Roll back to earlier versions if bugs are introduced
- See how your software developed over time
- Audit and review changes

## Why is Git Distributed?

Git is called **distributed** because the codebase isn't stored on just one server. Each developer has their own full copy of the project. They can make changes independently and later merge their work back into the main project.

## Why Git?

Git is a core topic in [MIT's Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), a course covering essential but often untaught tools for students and developers.

You don't need to be a Git expert—just knowing the basics is enough to maintain your repository and contribute to others. You can learn more advanced features as you go.

### Key Benefits of Git for Open Source

1. **Integrity of History**  
   Project history lets users trust the software. Anyone can see how the software evolved, when components were added, and track new changes. This transparency helps contributors focus on testing and auditing new code.

2. **Long-term Maintainability**  
   Git lets you associate commits with descriptive messages and author information. This helps future maintainers understand the code and contact past contributors if needed.

## My Approach to Learning Git

Many Git workshops focus on GitHub and treat Git as a side utility. Typically, they walk you through forking a repo, making a minor change via the GitHub web interface, and creating a pull request. While this is a good start, it misses important concepts.

I recommend putting **Git** at the center. Learning the command line utility will serve you well throughout your journey. Once you know Git, you can use any hosting service—not just GitHub.

> **Tip:** GitHub has a user-friendly UI, but mastering the command line gives you more power and flexibility.

## A Note About Git GUI Programs

I'm not against GUI programs. Occasionally, I use them too! But while learning, it's best to use the command line client. This way, you understand what's happening under the hood and strengthen your knowledge.
