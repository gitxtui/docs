# How I Resolve Merge Conflicts Easily

Merge conflicts happen when Git can’t automatically combine changes from different people. It’s not scary — it just means Git needs you to decide which changes to keep.

---

## Steps I Follow to Resolve Conflicts

1. **Check the conflicted files**  
   Git will tell you which files have conflicts after a merge or pull.

2. **Open the files and look for conflict markers**  
   You’ll see things like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch-name`.

3. **Decide which changes to keep**  
   You can keep your changes, the other person’s changes, or combine both.

4. **Remove the conflict markers**  
   Make sure the file looks exactly how you want it after merging.

5. **Save the file**  
   Confirm that it works and nothing is broken.

6. **Stage the resolved files**  
   ```bash
   git add <file-name>

7. **Commit the merge**
git commit

8. **Continue working normally**
Pull, push, or merge as usual.

Quick Tips
Communicate with teammates if unsure which changes to keep.
Keep commits small and pull often — fewer conflicts that way.
Don’t panic — conflicts are just Git asking for guidance.

Resolving merge conflicts is easy once you know the steps. Follow them carefully, and Git will never feel intimidating again.

Happy Coding!!
